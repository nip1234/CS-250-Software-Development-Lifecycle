### 1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?

The most important part of writing effective and useful software is interpreting the user's needs into a program. I approach my methodology by presenting solutions to user problems through the creation of functional, efficient, and easy-to-use software. In understanding user needs, I classify them as follows:

- **Functional Needs:** Details of what functions or capabilities users would want the program to possess.
- **Usability Needs:** The program should be intuitive, easy to use, and efficient.
- **Emotional Needs:** To generate trust and satisfaction in the user for a positive experience.

Research methods that I conduct include user interviews, surveys, usability testing, and analytics tracking to get a better picture of the user's needs.

User stories are essential in implementing these necessities into the software. This provides a description of something specific regarding the need of a user. They are expressed from the perspective of the user and involve their role, intention, and desired outcome. I use user stories to stand in their own shoes by dividing an entire bulky job into numerous smaller manageable parts. This approach facilitates communication among developers and stakeholders, ensuring alignment with the needs of the user.

### 2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

In developing programs, the aim is always to provide quality software that meets the requirements of the user while remaining responsive to change. This is achieved through iteration: Projects are broken up into increments. Each increment includes design, coding, testing, and code review. At the close of each iteration, I provide a deliverable product or feature that may be reviewed for further modification based on obtained feedback.

An Agile process I'd like to emphasize is **Scrum**. Through continuous improvement, collaboration, and flexibility, Scrum focuses on customer value. In the future, I'd like to integrate Scrum to emphasize a process of iterative development, customer feedback, and adaptability, which will help keep the development process efficient and truly user-centered.

### 3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development involves both technical skill and strong interpersonal qualities. Key characteristics include:

- **Communication:** Effectively discussing problems, asking questions, giving status updates, and explaining design choices or debugging strategies.
- **Collaboration:** Being easy to work with, working for the common good, and fostering a supportive and collaborative environment.
- **Flexibility:** Being open to learning new technologies and methods in a constantly changing business environment.
- **Responsibility:** Being accountable for their work; fixing errors in a timely manner and learning lessons from them.
- **Problem-Solving:** Identifying solutions to challenges and decomposing tasks into manageable pieces that can be distributed to team members.
- **Time Management:** Carrying out work activities in line with agreed priorities, ensuring high-quality and timely completion of projects.
- **Technical Expertise:** Never stop learning; continuously work on improving technical knowledge in software engineering and stay updated on new developments in the field.
